If marker can not be detected 
solve this problem by the following steps:

1. As @sloschi mentioned, change the image white part to light grey with rgb(240,240,240) and upload to online marker generate tool, then download the .patt file

2. Modify the code in aframe.js following this

3. Use this code in html:
<a-marker preset='custom' type='pattern' url='your-marker.patt'>...</a-marker>

then it will work.
